Rethinking Performance Assessment
https://hbr.org/2011/04/assessing-performance-from-ind/

[QUOTE]
This assumes that an individual’s responsibility is simply to do a
“good job.” In hierarchical organizations, the standard for gauging an
individual’s performance is typically whether an employee has met
specific objectives. As a corollary, the unwritten rule among
colleagues in most organizations today assumes individual autonomy —
“you do your job and I’ll do mine.” Peer relationships are typically
characterized by polite conflict avoidance, rather than the challenge,
debate, and openness to critique that are required for collaboration.

performance appraisals
http://www.businessballs.com/performanceappraisals.htm

[QUOTE]
Managers and appraisees commonly dislike appraisals and try to avoid
them. To these people the appraisal is daunting and
time-consuming. The process is seen as a difficult administrative
chore and emotionally challenging. The annual appraisal is maybe the
only time since last year that the two people have sat down together
for a meaningful one-to-one discussion. No wonder then that appraisals
are stressful - which then defeats the whole purpose.

There lies the main problem - and the remedy.

Appraisals are much easier, and especially more relaxed, if the boss
meets each of the team members individually and regularly for
one-to-one discussion throughout the year.
[/QUOTE]


[QUOTE]
Developing the whole-person is also an important aspect of modern
corporate responsibility, and separately (if you needed a purely
business-driven incentive for adopting these principles), whole-person
development is a crucial advantage in the employment market, in which
all employers compete to attract the best recruits, and to retain the
best staff.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
It is sometimes fashionable in the 'modern age' to dismiss traditional
processes such as performance appraisals as being irrelevant or
unhelpful. Be very wary however if considering removing appraisals
from your own organisational practices. It is likely that the critics
of the appraisal process are the people who can't conduct them very
well. It's a common human response to want to jettison something that
one finds difficult. Appraisals - in whatever form, and there are
various - have been a mainstay of management for decades, for good
reasons.

Think about everything that performance appraisals can achieve and contribute to when they are properly managed, for example:

+ performance measurement - transparent, short, medium and long term
+ clarifying, defining, redefining priorities and objectives
+ motivation through agreeing helpful aims and targets
+ motivation though achievement and feedback
+ training needs and learning desires - assessment and agreement
+ identification of personal strengths and direction - including unused hidden strengths
+ career and succession planning - personal and organisational
+ team roles clarification and team building
+ organisational training needs assessment and analysis
+ appraisee and manager mutual awareness, understanding and relationship
+ resolving confusions and misunderstandings
+ reinforcing and cascading organisational philosophies, values, aims, strategies, priorities, etc
+ delegation, additional responsibilities, employee growth and development
+ counselling and feedback
+ manager development - all good managers should be able to conduct appraisals well - it's a fundamental process
the list goes on..

Whoah, that's an awful lot of stuff that we're trying to do within
the one session. But actually, yes they're all valid. We need a
framework that ticks all of these.

This article gives quite a bit of food for thought. It describes well
what some of the plus sides are of performance reviews in general.


Why GE had to kill its annual performance reviews after more than three decades
http://qz.com/428813/ge-performance-review-strategy-shift/

[QUOTE]
The company got rid of formal, forced ranking around 10 years ago. But
now, GE’s in the middle of a far bigger shift. It’s abandoning formal
annual reviews and its legacy performance management system for its
300,000-strong workforce over the next couple of years, instead opting
for a less regimented system of more frequent feedback via an app. For
some employees, in smaller experimental groups, there won’t be any
numerical rankings whatsoever.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
“It existed in more or less the same form since I started at the
company in 1979,” GE’s head of human resources, Susan Peters, tells
Quartz. “But we think over many years it had become more a ritual than
moving the company upwards and forwards.”
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
“It’s a process that looks in the rear view mirror, that’s focused on
what you’ve done a year ago. That just isn’t current with how I think
we’re working and how many of the employees that we’re looking to
attract or grow have been raised.”
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
Each employee has a series of near-term goals, or “priorities.”
Managers are expected to have frequent discussions, called
“touchpoints,” on progress toward those goals and note what was
discussed, committed to, and resolved. The app can provide summaries
on command, through typed notes, photographs of a notepad, or even
voice recordings. The focus isn’t on grading how well people are
doing, but on constant improvement.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
The shift in how GE employees think about and track their performance
mirrors the broader transition underway at the company to
substantially simplify its business. “FastWorks” is a successor in
many ways to Six Sigma and consciously mimics the way that companies
in Silicon Valley work. There’s a focus on rapid and frequent
experimentation, learning from the market, only funding projects that
prove themselves, and acceptance and willingness to move on from
failures.
[/QUOTE]

Note: search for GE FastWorks

[QUOTE]
As much as researchers and many employees might applaud the decision,
it doesn’t mean it’s going to be easy. There’s a reason reviews have
stuck around for so long, and it’s hard to overemphasize how
entrenched the annual review has become. It’s the way most were raised
as employees, a huge part of their workload, and a comfortable
framework to administer and to defend pay, promotion, and firing
decisions. Adobe’s Morris says that one of her biggest obstacles was
actually convincing her own people that this could work.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
The harshest critics of performance reviews and ratings argue that
numerical rankings and pay differentiation are perhaps the most
damaging parts of the system, and that any regime that preserves them
can’t hope to truly change. And many companies like the idea of
getting rid of reviews and rankings, but struggle to follow through.

Checking in on the Performance Review
https://www.cultureamp.com/zine/004-checking-in-on-the-performance-review.html

[QUOTE]
In 2012, Morris and Adobe instituted a “check-in” method. With the
check-in procedure, employees and managers discuss goals and tasks in
an ongoing manner, rather than one time a year.

Morris believes constant feedback in real time helps direct employees
while they’re working on the task at hand, and that people are more
effective when they know where they stand at all times.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
In addition to the apparent time/energy/money-suck that these companies believe performance reviews are, some believe the information obtained is also inaccurate.

“It turns out this mistrust is well-founded,” says Rose
Mueller-Hanson, HR practice leader at the CEB. “Our research shows
that individual performance ratings have absolutely zero correlation
with actual business results. Many of our members and clients have
started to really question the return they are getting from all this
work.”
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
“Personally, I like a hybrid model of ongoing feedback, but more
formal mid-year and end-of-year reviews,” Singer says. “If you look in
the mirror everyday you can't really tell if you have lost or gained
weight. Same with reviews, if they are too often they will start to
look the same - I suspect companies will figure that out soon.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
“Compensation (pay increases, bonuses, promotions) are typically an
annual event based on the traditional review method,” he says. “This
could really start to take up a lot of managers and HRs time. None of
the articles I have read so far have addressed how pay works in this
new structure.”

Team Vs. Individual Performance Appraisals
http://smallbusiness.chron.com/team-vs-individual-performance-appraisals-20040.html

Not too much substance, but starts to tease at the relation between
day to day working behaviours and the performance appraisal method. I
wonder if there is a cause-effect relation between the appraisal and
the working practices. Does an individual-only performance system
bias the workplace to individual-only working patterns?



How to Document a Performance Review

the review framework itself.


Involving employees in meeting corporate objectives
http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/taylor-woodrow/involving-employees-in-meeting-corporate-objectives/introduction.html#axzz3vOLAu7PV

[QUOTE]
Effective Human Resource Development (HRD) involves matching an
organisation's needs with the needs of its employees. 
[/QUOTE]

Does this imply that all objectives should have a 'why' element to
them? "Do X because Y." There might be some mileage in that.

[QUOTE]
Like people, organisations have distinguishing characteristics. These
usually feature in an organisation's vision and culture.
[/QUOTE]

Who is our 'organisation'? Rolls-Royce? DaVinci? ADRC? DSE? This is a
useful excercise - who are 'we' and what are our collective goals
beyond just project delivery. All objectives should contribute to
project delivery in a way that is compatible with these broader goals.

The 'Trusted to Deliver Excellence' motif could be a useful
tool. Despite sounding fantastic, by itself it is quite
meaningless. But it leaves room to add on a local interpretation of
each of the words.

[QUOTE]
Taylor Woodrow believes that the effective management of individual
performance rests on managing the performance cycle, which is an
ongoing process of performance planning, support and review.
[/QUOTE]

They then prattle on about performance related pay in this
case-study - I'm completely unreceptive to arguments that assume that
people are singularly motivated by the carrot of pay rises (or the
stick of missing out).

Generally good, short post. References some work of this Pfeffer chap

One point that I noted...

[QUOTE]
4. I am not saying people don’t need feedback on their performance at
   work. People need feedback–which is information about performance,
   not evaluation–on a frequent basis. The more we can design systems
   where the feedback comes from the work, the better (e.g., build
   lights, green bar/red bar test frames). Peer feedback and feedback
   from managers are crucial for improving performance.
[/QUOTE]

I'm a big fan of this. The more that we can build feedback into the
work itself, the better.

Get Rid of the Performance Review!
http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122426318874844933

I'm not too convinced that this is a very useful article. It rails
against what seems to be a fairly extreme for of performance review -
not what we are actually using.

He introduces the alternative of Performance /Previews/, which are
regular, forward (not backward) looking sessions aimed at using the
worker-manager relationship to continually try to improve
effectiveness. If these sessions are done regularly then there is no
need for an end of year review, or at least at the end of year review
it is the worker-manager pairing that is under review.

[QUOTE]
OBJECTIVITY IS SUBJECTIVE
Most performance reviews are staged as "objective" commentary, as if
any two supervisors would reach the same conclusions about the merits
and faults of the subordinate. 
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
What's more, people don't want to pay a high price for acknowledging
their need for improvement -- which is exactly what they would do if
they arm the boss with the kind of personal information he or she
would need to help them develop. It could all come back to haunt them
in the performance review. No wonder the developmental discussions the
boss wants to inject at the time of a performance review so often get
categorized by subordinates as gun-to-the-head intimidation requiring
false acquiescence, lip-service agreement and insincere,
appearance-correcting actions.
[/QUOTE]

[QUOTE]
IMMORALITY OF JUSTIFYING CORPORATE IMPROVEMENT
I believe it's immoral to maintain the facade that annual pay and
performance reviews lead to corporate improvement, when it's clear
they lead to more bogus activities than valid ones. Instead of
energizing individuals, they are dispiriting and create
cynicism. Instead of stimulating corporate effectiveness, they lead to
just-in-case and cover-your-behind activities that reduce the amount
of time that could be put to productive use. Instead of promoting
directness, honesty and candor, they stimulate inauthentic
conversations in which people cast self-interested pursuits as
essential company activities.
