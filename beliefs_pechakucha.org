1. Introduce the format

Pecha Kucha (Japanese: chit-chat)

20 slides, each shown for 20 seconds each
6:40 total presentation time

Designed to give communicate a lot of information in a very short
time, and to NOT BE BORING.


2. About me

Mech. Eng by education

EPDS for ~5 years


2.1. About me

Past few years have been steering away from traditional engineering
and more towards software development.

2.2. About me

Now deeply interested in agile development: techniques, values and
principles.


3. Headline topic

These are the things that I think about in the shower.


4. Team performance > individual performance

Teams get things done.


4.1. How do we...
1. Structure work so that it can be carried out by cohesive teams
2. Create an environment where teams can form around emerging work
3. Provide the conditions and coaching for teams to reach higher (and
   higher and higher) levels of performance


5. Self-direction and autonomy > compliance

Better decisions
Faster decisions
Better engagement
More effective action


6. Focus > Multi-tasking

Multi-tasking is bad, singular focus is good

Both in terms of active WIP and wearing many-hats

2 principles at work:

6.1. Context switching (the biggie)

6.2. Delayed time to complete

6.3. Each hat carries an overhead and competes for resource


7. Collaborative decisions > unilateral decisions

Open & collaborative decision-making feels harder but gives better
decisions.

Don't just inform stakeholders. Have stakeholders make the decision!


7.1

Characteristics:
- S l o w . . .
- Scary to give up control and trust the group
- Can be done badly: groupthink, bike-shedding, ...

+ More creative minds at work -> better decisions
+ Engaged stakeholders -> commitment to the solution


8. The system > the individual


The supposition is prevalent the world over that there would be no
problems in production or service if only our production workers would
do their jobs in the way that they were taught. Pleasant dreams. The
workers are handicapped by the system, and the system belongs to the
management.

W. Edwards Deming, Out of the Crisis, page 134


8.1

Pygmalion effect - individuals develop the qualities projected on them
by the system that they operate in.


9. Intrinsic motivation > extrinsic motivation

Autonomy

Mastery

Purpose


9.1

Super-powerful

but super-fragile.


10. Continuous Improvement > *

A healthy continuous improvement process is *the most important thing*

+ Strive for excellence
+ Adapt to changing conditions


10.1

Given enough time, could reinvent lean principles and practices in
their entirety.
