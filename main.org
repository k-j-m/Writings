** Preface

This is a thinking piece. The intention is to straighten out some
of my current thoughts and to deconstruct our current
organisation and processes so that we can rebuild them from lower
level concepts. It would be a perfectly valid outcome to rebuild
today's current state exactly, along with rationale that describes
why everything is how it is.

Because of this approach I'm taking (break it apart and then build it
back up) it is going to look like I am being almost petulant in the
way I pick arguments. My apologiees: that is just how I am choosing to
attack the problem.


** Introduction

What is the purpose of the Organisation?

1. To create an environment that allows a large number of individuals
   to work with a common purpose to achieve results that are greater
   than the sum of individual efforts. One hundred individuals cannot
   build a very good bridge, but a team of one-hundred can.

Is there really anything else?

Focussing specifically on the operation of our department, the
organisation provides a number of important functions.

1. Salaries for salaried staff
2. Cash for external resource (contractors, vendors) and internal
   resource
3. Infrastructure (office space, IT support, ...)
4. Career progression opportunities
5. A clear sense of purpose to engage and motivate employees

I don't think that it is the purpose of the central organisation to
provide incentives to motivate the staff. It is the job of each
organisational unit to make sure that employees are motivated. There
will be constraints to do with pay structure and union agreements -
until these constraints are explicitly stated then there is such an
asymmetric balance of information that constructive conversation
becomes really difficult.

*ACTION*: find out more about union/company relations


** What is OUR purpose?

Why was the ADRC established? It can't just be a matter of
co-location.

Part of the rationale behind the ADRC is that we want...

+ *greater and more controlled delivery of value to the business*
+ more productive (greater throughput of useful work)
+ agile (better able to start and change direction according to the
  requirements of the business)
+ better able to amplify our efforts by leveraging academia and
  outsourcing

The first of these is really the king and should really be expanded
on at length before diving into other topics. But I have other topics
on my mind just now so I will try to get some thoughts down first
before I lose them.

All of these aspirations sit at a higher level than we can
practically control. To make progress towards these goals we need to
identify the different behaviours or qualities that will directly
contribute to achieving the goals.

This is an un-ordered list, and each of these bullets is a half-baked
idea. I want to list these concepts to give a framework to
link later ideas in to. All proposals/suggestions/critiques must link
back to this 'list of things we need to do to move closer to the
departments goal'

+ remove conflicts of interest
+ reduce organisational inertia - the ability to start up/shut down
  projects
+ reduce project inertia - make it easier to change direction within
  a project as the problem domain becomes better understood.
+ identify core competencies - what are the things that we need to be
  good at today? What are the things that we need to be good at next
  year?
+ establish a positive pressure up the learning curve - how are we
  making sure that we are actually increasing our capability over
  time?
+ improve information exchange at all levels - within projects,
  between projects, amongst skill groups.


** Appeal to intrinsic motivators

Poke point: if we can't attack some organisation-wide sacred-cows
then HPC is all just a pile of hot air.

It is not OK for us to work rigidly within strict rules set by the
central oganisation - we need much more departmental and individual
autonomy to really make HPC fly.

[QUOTE from Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance p183]
This is a tragedy, however, only if you presume that the cart of
civilization, 'the system,' is pulled by mules. This is a common,
vocational, 'location' point of view, but it's not the Church [of
Reason (a theme in the book)] attitude.
The Church attitude is that civilization, or 'the system' or
'society' or whatever you wasnt to call it, is best served not by
mules but by free men. The purpose of abolishing grades and degrees
is not to punish mules or to get rid of them but to provide an
environment in which that mule can turn into a free man.
[/QUTOE]

** Objective setting and PDRs

I have a number of criticisms of the PDR + objective setting
process. I don't quite know how to form these in to a nice narrative
so I'm going to start by just typing into a number of sub-headings
and hopefully rework things from there.

*** Planning for annual objectives is infeasible

Requirements are volatile (assumption: this is a fundamental truth -
any attempt to remove the volatility is mis-guided), meaning that any
attempt to write annual objectives that relate to customer
requirements (except in a meta-sense) is a work of fiction based on
what we /think/ the customer/project requirements are going to be
over the course of the year. This gives rise to two scenarios at
either end of the spectrum. One where we stick to the process but
try to maintain individual (and hence project) agility; another where
we stick to the process to the letter and trade firm objectives for
agility. 

1. Annual objectives are drafted and are then updated daily to reflect
   the new understanding of reality. We are sticking to the rules in
   the sense that we are not changing anything retrospectively and
   we are only ever working on things that can be traced directly to
   our objectives. There is however a major overhead in maintaining a
   rolling forecast of work to the end of the calendar year.

2. Annual objectives are drafted at the start of the year and are not
   changed through the course of the year. If the project
   requirements change, then the individual cannot accommodate the
   change because they are not in the objectives.

As mentioned, these two scenarios are at the two extremes of a
spectrum and we would never expect to see either one in practice. But
I suggest that there is no happy medium between the two, just
different combinations of where the same pain comes from - like
choosing how to divide a Â£100 debt between your left and right
pockets.

The debt in this case is the overhead of maintaining the objectives
as a forecast of work through the year, the pockets are whether you
choose to pay in terms of agility or overhead in updating the
objectives.

If we stick to the rules, these are the only options. If we allow
ourselves to break the rules then some more possibilities arise.

3. Work off-plan and retrospectively change objectives.

4. Work off-plan and neglect to change objectives.


*** Individual objectives are project planning in disguise

Writing down what an individual's individual contributions are going
to be towards their respective projects - sound at all familiar?

This is project planning! What are the tasks that are going to be
carried out by the different project resources in a predicted
timeframe. Except individuals are at a disadvantage. They do not have
the benefit of a project-wide view on how their work is going to
contribute to a project. Additionally, the projects have the luxury
of being able to choose project planning timeframes to better suit
the natural cadence of the project. There will be forces that drive
this to align with the calendar year, but no strict
constraints. Having the individual and project carry out similar, but
disconnected, planning tasks is a great way to duplicate effort and
introduce conflicts of interest where the results don't quite align.

Project planning is a project activity, not an individual activity
and absolutely not an activity that individuals should be appraised
against. This is downright unfair.


*** Individual objectives harm shared ownership and collaboration

Having specific jobs appear in individual's objectives implies that
every task should have a specific owner who has responsibility for
(and can claim credit for) completing the work.

If annual objectives and PDR gradings are considered important, I
can't ask a team mate to sacrifice one of their objectives to help
with my own. Similarly I am not incentivised to offer my own help for
work that isn't listed in my objectives, but for which I can see
potential benefit elsewhere.

The penalty here is agility, but in the sense of preventing
serendipitous cross-fertilization of ideas rather than project inertia
in responding to new requirements.


*** Traditionally written objectives do not promote risk-taking

*Assertion: failure is a good thing*

I'm not sure if this is a criticism more of the objective-setting
process or of the PDR process. The gist of it is that if our /worth/
is measured by how we weigh up against our objectives, then it pays
to play it safe. This is completely at odds with the idea that a) we
want to stretch ourselves to the point where failure must be an
option, and b) we simply must experiment with new ideas if we want to
find the big winners that actually pay off - this is the scientific
method. 

I'm quite sure of this, but these aren't yet fully formed ideas -
search for references.

We need to figure out a framework to encourage people to *safely*
experiment and take risks.


*** Traditionally written objectives do not promote learning and feedback

What if the last 9 months of work completely depends on the outcomes
of the first 3 months? How can that feedback be captured in the
objectives?

What if we worked with many of these feedback loops within a given
year? I suspect that this is how a lot of people work.


*** Why are objectives private?

If there are real personal or political reasons that objectives be
kept private then fine! Otherwise private objectives are just a
source of crossed-wires, confusion and ulterior motives. If you can't
declare publicly what you're working on then you shouldn't be working
on it.

This promotes a new mind-set as well that objectives are something
that we should talk about with each other. 

*I will print out my objectives and stick them on a notice-board
in 2016.*

Is this worth taking further - should objective setting be a group
activity? Everyone in a team (team = people working towards a common
objective) gathers together prepared with a list of the things that
they think their objectives should be for the year. Each item goes up
for discussion and after modification gets approved as a team-agreed
individual objective. 


*** PDR gradings don't add any value

I seriously don't see any value in PDR gradings. Instead I will have a
go at listing some of the proposed benefits and suggest one of three
responses: 
a) this goal is not served by the PDR gradings
b) this goal should not be a goal
c) this goal would be better served through other means


Assertion:
We need to recognise good performance so that we can reward it.

Response:
There is a large body of writing that suggests that individual
merit-based reward and recognition is a harmful thing.

*ABORT* read through all of these links before you continue


*** PDR gradings dis-incentivise honest self-feedback

Why would you ever encourage fair and honest feedback if it's going to
be written down as a poor rating on your scorecard? The PDR ratings
are there to be gamed.

This is such a huge conflict of interest - I really, really, dislike
it.


*** PDR gradings put the emphasis on the individual rather than the system

hi di ho de hum


** Reduce Inventory of WIP

There is a lot of half-finished work in the world. How can we
identify, categorise and reduce our inventory?



** Thought Experiment

*QUESTION*
What would happen if an individual refused to acknowledge the PDR
grading system?

This 'refusal to acknowledge' might be a pre-emptive refusal to
click /accept/ any PDR gradings that are not exactly in the middle of
the scale. Or a stronger variant would be resfusing to accept any
gradings except the *WORST*. Or perhaps it would just be a refusal to
click 'accept'. I think the medium-rating version is probably the
most suitable for this discussion. The intention isn't to cause the
system to grind to a halt, but just to stop believing in it.

Would there be disciplinary action of the individual? Disciplinary
action for management?

*QUESTION*
Would it make a difference if the individual was a consistently high
achiever?

This removes the question of motives. By accepting only medium grades
the high-performing individual is doing themselves harm.

*QUESTION*
*Would it make a difference if they made a convincing argument that
the reason they refuse to acknowledge the grading system is that it is
bad for the business?*

This clarifies their motives and mindset. By stating explicitly that
they are acting for the benefit of the company (at least in their
own mind) then it follows that within their value-system any
disciplinary action is *against* the company. This makes it clear to
the adversary that they have a responsibility to explain their
actions.

*QUESTION*
What if it was an entire team that collectively agreed to stop
believing in the grading system?

*QUESTION*
What if the team's performance measurably improved as a result?

This would make a measured truth that the team's actions have been in
the interest of the company. Either there are other benefits to
gradings NOT related to performance, or the system should be killed.


** A Practical Approach

All of the discussion so far has been fairly destructive. It is easy
to pick flaws with the current system, but much more difficult to
suggest what we actually want to /do/.

Here are some suggestions for modifications to the current system.


1. Make all objectives public

Why? 
Improved communication. Fewer crossed wires. Less chance of conflicts
of interest. Opportunity for feedback on contentious, ambiguous or
incorrect objectives.

How?
This doesn't need any changes to the current system - all that is
needed is to have individuals print out their own objectives and
lay them on a table.


2. Make objective-setting a team activity

Why?
This is an extension of the point above. The earliest possible
opportunity for feedback is when the objectives are first being
written.

This also puts more emphasis on team objectives. What are the team
objectives and how do the individual objectives help to support them?

How?
Have people do some homework drafting a big list of things that they
think the project should achieve over the course of the year and then
arrange a team meeting to carve out a small set of team/project
objectives that everyone subscribes to. Then cycle round the room
filling in the objectives for each individual, making sure that
everyone agrees on the allocation of responsibilities.

This doesn't need any change to the formal system. A populated list
of objectives is a product of this exercise.


3. Write *stable* objectives

Why?
Maintaining a projection of planned work within each individual's
objectives incurs an overhead that must be paid in one of a few forms:

+ agility - the ability to change plans based on learning and
  feedback throughout the year

+ effort - the effort required to update all affected individuals'
  objectives after every change of course

+ compliance - to have individuals working on tasks that are not
  listed in their objectives

It should be extremely rare to have to say "yeah, we thought that was
important but ended up rescheduling it into next year".

How?
The key to this is to *avoid any volatile specifics!* 

One option is to just plainly inherit the team objectives: "Support
the team objective to <xyz>." Another would be to write
process-oriented objectives: "I will follow the process, yadda yadda."

I'm seriously struggling to square this with the SMART view of the
world: how can we make objectives Specific whilst also keeping them at
a high enough level that they are suitably stable?

I think one answer to this is that the objective stay at a high
level, but to have all of the work products that contribute to the
objective be specific and measurable.

The question then becomes how to evaluate the listed work products
against the high level objective? How do you decide if an objective
is completed and how do you decide on a PDR rating? Answer: you
can't. [ARGH this is so absolutely infuriating! How can we get passed
this!? Is it just the rating system that is being difficult here or am
I just completely fixated on it?]

Changes?
Need to agree on a means of rating high-level objectives using
low-level metrics.

*The trouble with S from SMART*

This one got me thinking: why is it so hard to assign a rating to a
high-level objective and why are we able to avoid the problem with
the current system?

The answer as I see it is that we trade one hard question for
another, and then choose to ignore the new one.

We choose not to answer the question "how to rate general high-level
objectives" and instead replace the high-level objectives with a
number of more-specific low-level objectives. /OK GREAT! What's the
problem?/ Unfortunately, this sneaks in a new question that I haven't
ever seen properly addressed: how do these specific objectives rate
against the ultimate objective of doing your utmost to benefit the
business?

I can write some crummy objectives that I can pass with flying
colours, but which won't really justify an overall good rating: eg "Ken will
come in to work every day that he hasn't booked as holiday (provided
that he isn't unwell)."

Similarly I can write some objectives which would revolutionalise the
company, winning unprecendented market share and making billions of
pounds profit! And then flunk all of them.

My performance through the year might be identical - meaning that I
should get an identical performance rating. So someone (management?)
still needs to make the value judgement that can arrive at the same
performance rating from both ends of the spectrum.

It is more likely that there is some sort of game that gets played
between the manager and worker that is won by promising as little as
is credible and then over delivering. *It is unfair to make people
play this game! Please stop it!*

To summarise my understanding of the situation:
+ it is hard to objectively rate performance against ambiguous
  high-level objectives
+ you can avoid that difficult value judgement by instead writing
  specific low-level objectives
+ the number and scope of low-level objectives is THE SAME VALUE
  JUDGEMENT, except it has been cunningly pushed on to the worker
+ the company gets to use objective metrics to justify whatever
  decisions they get used for (merit pay, hiring/firing)
+ the worker creates the stick that will be used to strike him later

Something that concerns me is that the PDRs feature in the
technologist structure by inclusion in the boarding pack
requirements. I had previously thought that the technologist structure
was completely solid.


4. Avoid individual ownership of team objectives

Why?
This is a collaboration killer and we should kill it! We promote the
idea right from the the lowest level that jobs have individual owners.

How?
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! 


5. Uniformly weight the team's ratings based on project performance,
   not individual performannce.

Why?
Encourages the team to look after the team objectives, rather than
individuals looking after individual objectives. This is a possible
implementation of the previous point.

How?
HOW DO YOU RATE THE PROJECT PERFORMANCE!?!?!?!?!?!? It's the same
problems over and over and over and over again.

But hold on, it's different... it pushes the problem back one step
further up the organisation. It becomes a way of saying "Dear
Organisation, if you don't know how to rate projects then please stop
asking us to rate ourselves." Or something like that...
